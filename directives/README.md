### Structural Directives

It's used to change the structure of DOM by adding or removing DOM elements.  
This directive has an \* sign before the directive, they are mainly used to create, hide, destroy, disable DOM elements.

#### Types of Structural Directives:

- [ngIf](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Angular-Learning/tree/directive-assignment/directives/src/app/ng-if).
- [ngIfElse](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Angular-Learning/tree/directive-assignment/directives/src/app/ng-if-else).
- [ngFor](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Angular-Learning/tree/directive-assignment/directives/src/app/ng-for).
- [ngSwitch](https://github.com/OubaidaAkilan/Angular-Learning/tree/directive-assignment/directives/src/app/ng-switch).

ngIf :It is used to display or hide an element based on the condition determined by the expression we pass into the directive.The element will be removed if the result of expression is return false.

ngFor :In this directive, DOM elements are repeated and one element from an array is passed each time.  
It is the structural directive which will add or remove components from the DOM.  
ngFor is basically a for loop which is used to create some repeating elements on the DOM.

ngSwitch :This directive is allow us to add or remove the element depending on a match expression.  
It is used to render different elements depending on a given condition.  
It contains three separate directives. ngSwitch, ngSwitchCase & ngSwitchDefault.
